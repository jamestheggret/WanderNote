                    <p>"In the bustling metropolis of Gingoog City, <span>James Benson V. Neri</span> , an IT student with a passion for photography and
                    Photoshop skills, embarks on a journey of self-discovery within the enigmatic realm of technology. While mastering the
                    art of coding proves challenging, James navigates through its complexities with determination and perseverance. As a
                    typical college student, he finds solace in the simplicity of school life, indulging in hobbies like reading light
                    novels and manga, and playing games for relaxation. Despite feeling disconnected from society at times, James seeks
                    answers, driven by a desire to better understand himself and the world around him, eagerly anticipating the challenges
                    and triumphs that lie ahead in his journey toward the future."</p>

                    This blog is an extension of my <span>STEM Grade 12 project</span>, a vlog documenting our travel journey from Gingoog to Cagayan De
                Oro. Packing commenced before our departure, with numerous pit stops along the way to allow our driver, my father, to
                rest. Nervous excitement gripped me as my sister urged me to begin recording the video. Although I had experience with
                casual video recording on my cellphone, creating a vlog proved to be a daunting task. Crafting a captivating vlog
                necessitates meticulous effort to compile numerous recordings—often totaling between 20 to 30—into a coherent narrative.
                As I navigated through the editing process, I realized the intricacies involved in weaving together disparate moments
                into a cohesive story. Each clip, whether capturing an epic adventure or a lighthearted moment, required careful
                consideration for pacing and narrative flow. Despite the challenges, witnessing the final product—a montage of our
                journey's highlights—filled me with a sense of pride and accomplishment.

                <p>
                    During our travels, amidst laughter and jokes, I attempted a humorous remark about the charm of watching dramas, which
                unexpectedly sparked amusement from my parents. However, my intended phrase of 'how dare they' was inadvertently
                replaced with 'who dare they,' resulting in a moment of light embarrassment. As we journeyed onwards, passing through
                Balingasag, my attention was drawn to the familiar sight of a gas station adjacent to a bank. Feeling the need for a pit
                stop after indulging in a snack of boiled eggs, I suggested a brief bathroom break.    
                Before long, our car rolled into Cagayan De Oro, catching me off guard amidst our banter and jokes. Our plans for the
                day included grabbing breakfast at Seafood Haven, followed by a visit to the furniture store nestled behind Centrio
                Mall. My sister's goal for a new chair led us to stumble upon a '<span>Gaming Chair,</span>' sparking a lively debate on its merits.    
                As we embarked on a journey to Xavier University, where my sister was eager to share her experiences, I found myself
                contemplating the allure of a gaming chair. Our excursion continued at Centrio Mall, where we explored various
                electronics stores, scrutinizing prices for headphones and other accessories for my Playstation."

                    After our trip in Centrio, We started our journey with prayers at Divine Mercy, lighting candles for our intentions. Then, we made our way 
                    to S & R mall for groceries and a satisfying lunch. Resting for a night at a hotel in Estrella, we recharged for 
                    the next day's adventures. Gaisano beckoned us for more shopping, where we began with a hearty breakfast at Chowking. 
                    Exploring the mall, we browsed for new outfits and necessities, taking our time on each floor. The food court provided 
                    a delightful break, where we enjoyed delicious meals and refreshing drinks. As the day progressed, we decided on an 
                    early dinner at Talisyan Seafood Restaurant, discovering a new park nearby with exciting entertainment options. Capturing 
                    memories through photos, we savored the moments before heading home. Our dog welcomed us with wagging tails, signaling 
                    the end of our fulfilling travels through Cagayan. The <span>Video</span> will show its proof.</p>

                        In this Photography Blog, That was day that my life has changed, meeting new friends and collecting memories 
                        is important because of the day of my new phone, it gives strong impression of the camera's function, high resolution,
                        new effects and lenses. I wanted to take pictures as a part of changing my way of life, to improve and find myself to
                        avoid mistakes of being careless.With each snap of the shutter, I found myself immersing deeper into the art of storytelling, 
                        weaving narratives through the lens that spoke volumes beyond words.The newfound clarity and precision of my phone's camera 
                        opened up a world of creative possibilities, allowing me to experiment with composition, lighting, and perspective like never before.
                        Through photography, I discovered the power of mindfulness, as each moment spent framing the perfect shot became a meditation 
                        on presence and appreciation for the beauty inherent in every scene.

                    <p>Despite the life, i've felt like i can become a photographer when i grew up, due to my lack of interest of my future job. I pick the
                        easy one, not to mention a good one, to check the outside world among my own imagination. But within the lens of my camera, I discovered 
                        a realm where creativity knew no bounds and passion ignited like a flame in the darkness. Photography became my sanctuary, a place where 
                        I could escape the monotony of everyday life and capture moments of beauty and wonder. Through the art of photography, I found not only a 
                        hobby but a calling, a path toward self-discovery and fulfillment I never knew existed.

                    <p>After my interest is piqued, i want to keep picturing as a token to never forget and always carried as a part of fragment memory. My parents
                        was happy that i can take pictures, because back then, i was been fooled by others to take picture, i thought it was a waste of time. But think
                        back, what would happen if everyone whose close to me are separated after time passed. So i just dont want to forget them. Those 3 pictures are 
                        proof that i can change, having selfies with my family and friends and funny moments to bond ourselves and understand each other's feeling. The <span>
                        Video </span>can see the truth in front of your eyes. And i added a music from a game that counts a relaxing theme when you imagine a place,
                        that shows a Cafe Restaurant, drinking coffee with good melody from the a jukebox. That feeling will never be forgotten.
